Bonnie blue is a cute little restaurant where the back half of the restaurant has tables for dinner/lunch and the front part has more of a cafe feel. They sale bakery items and coffee up in the front. They sale Natty Boh beer so if you are a MD person this is where to get that in the ole VA.I have eaten at bonnie blue multiple times so I have been able to try many dishes here.1) Shrimp and Grits - hard no for me. Shrimp and Grits is probably my favorite dish to eat and the way BB prepared it was just not great for the ole taste buds. It felt like they were trying to do a twist on it and make it there own but they'd gone on too far of a limb. White wine sauce just did not do it for me. It did not have enough of a cajun flavor or really any other flavor than the white wine.2) BBQ - I would say it is mediocre BBQ (I actually prefer the taste of Mission BBQ in town). They have a limited selection of BBQ sauces - and honestly that can make or break the BBQ. They do have good BBQ chicken. Coleslaw here is far too vinegar basted and is overwhelming3) BRUNCH. They serve brunch on the weekends. Mimosa I had was yum (hard to screw up orange juice and champagne especially when the orange juice is store bought). They do offer an apple cider mimosa which I did not try. Blood Marys here have a kick to them especially towards the end of the sip - so beware.I had an omelette (3 meat), grits, bacon and biscuit for brunch. Omelette and the grits both needed seasoning. To me it was like they just threw an omelette and some grits on the plate with no seasoning. I added salt and pepper to both of \\xa0my dishes. I'm typically not a seasoner at restaurants. The bacon was so dang crispy it literally could be broken in half with your hands. Biscuit was good and they had jellies that were also good. Bakery items like cookies are yum and huge\"},\n",

The Mac and cheese was your typical run of the mill, tasty but nothing special, Mac. The collard greens were buttery soft and sweet, cooked to perfection with some pork for flavoring and I would highly recommend them as your side. The barbecue was so tender and delicious, pulled but not too stringy with a small amount of sauce poured over too. This preparation allowed for me to really taste the flavor of the slow-cooked pork rather than having small bits of pork covered in sauce like some bbq, where you really taste the sauce more than anything. I ate some pork on my biscuit and it was truly a lunch that cake close to perfection.My husband had the fried chicken platter and he was also impressed! I tried his chicken and it was crispy without too much breading and didn't seem too greasy. Yum.We'll be back on our next stop through Winchester, for sure.\"},\n",

Very hard to believe this was rated one of the top bbq places on the east coast. Maybe I went on a bad day? My date's meat plate was also just as bland.

The restaurant is located in the historic area of town in an old 1921 gas station. It's adorable. I ordered the three meat combo and tried the brisket, ribs and pulled pork, collard greens and side salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. So delicious I ended up coming back the next day and ordering the same thing. Even their iced tea and house made green goddess dressing was really good. Although I didn't try them, they had tons of amazing looking homemade baked goods to choose from too! A definite must try if you're in the area!\"},\n",

Little did we know that this week we would be passing back thru but decided that this was our chance to go back for breakfast. Sasha, our waiter, was terrific! I had read how good their fried oysters were and was craving them so he made that happen even tho they were not on the breakfast menu! So yummy! Apparently this is a hot little locals dive (I say that lovingly!) and am so glad we were able to make it back! Everything is made from scratch right there and it's all delicious!

       "  'text': \"Bonnie Blue just celebrated its fifth year in Winchester. This quaint little restaurant is located in a renovated filling station. Fun for me because I remember my dad fueling up there when I was younger! \\xa0The restaurant was originally just a big community table and some bars with stools along the windows. Over the last few years, they have been expanding to create a larger dining room and an outdoor area. The decor is just charming!I would really love to give them more stars... if I had written this review years ago it would have been five stars. It just seems that every time I go, it isn't nearly as good as the time before and the prices keep going up. A dinner with two sides and a piece of bread averages 15 bucks. A small portion of a side is 3 dollars. Even the desserts have gone up to around $4 or more for a cookie bar. \\xa0The food that was once just so awesome that I would actually crave it, now is just meh... They smoke all of their meats on site, which is great. All food, including the baked goods are made on site. I have just stopped feeling that element of putting love into their food and service. The last few times I have been in, the order was wrong. The people working at the take out counter are now smarmy youth who honestly don't care about how customers feel. They don't make you feel valued or really welcomed. This is just an element of their age and lack of skills.The dinners that once had portions so large that you could have leftovers for the next day have been made smaller. My go to order is the Dixie Pig which is a baked potato loaded and topped with pork barbecue. Always good... until my last two visits... once the potato was not cooked through, both times the meat was dry and a bit tough, and both times there wasn't enough sour cream or cheese. And a drink to wash it down with will set you back another $3. One thing that is great is the sauce, though you should always ask for some extra.The deserts are wonderful. I am willing to pay more for them because I know they are all made from scratch. The lemon bars and the millionaire bars are to die for! While I love to support local shops in town, I just don't visit near as often as I used to. I feel like all of the expansion has come at a sacrifice to quality and personable service. Be sure to check their hours because they close earlier than the dinner hour. After the last few visits, I am not sure I will go here for lunch or dinner anymore. I will keep going for desserts!\"},\n",

While we were waiting, another couple came in behind us. After another 5 min went by, one of the waiters came up and took the couple who came in after us back because they knew each other and just left us standing there. So rude!

       "  'text': \"I have to bump down Bonnie Blue a little. \\xa0On my wife and I's most recent visit (my older brother lives in Winchester), we stopped in for some morning coffee and breakfast or pastries. \\xa0We also had our 10 year old niece with us. \\xa0We weren't wanting anything heavy, but when we came in we were bombarded by every employee with the question of whether we we wanted to eat in or take out. \\xa0I felt like we got pressured into sitting in their new dinning room. \\xa0We had to awkwardly walk through the kitchen to get there. \\xa0When we sat down, we told the server we wanted two regular coffees. \\xa0We looked over the small, one sided menu. \\xa0There were about 7 things to pick from and they were all heavy meat and potato type options. \\xa0It was 11:15. \\xa0We we're wanting breakfast, not BBQ. \\xa0So, we got back up from our table, walked through the kitchen, and told the server that we weren't going to dine in. \\xa0The girl running the barista counter was finishing our coffees. \\xa0We ordered some blueberry muffins and ate at the side counter. \\xa0The biggest complaint of Bonnie Blue I now have is that I'm not sure what it's supposed to be...a bakery, a coffee shop, a wine and local fare bistro, or a BBQ joint?? \\xa0If someone were to walk off the street and into the restaurant that person would have a difficult time determining what the eating options even are. \\xa0Lastly, and the biggest disappointment of all was that our house, drip coffee was HORRIBLE! \\xa0It was a dark, gritty sludge. \\xa0It was some type of pour over or something. \\xa0It took a huge amount of half and half to get it to lighten up and even then, it was tough to swallow. \\xa0My wife only drank a third of her cup.\"},\n",

This was a stop on our way back to NY from Florida. I am so glad we stopped here. The most difficult part was deciding on what to order. Having a Cuban sandwich for breakfast is something that blew me away. The sandwich was huge and full of flavor. My wife order the pulled pork and eggs. The pulled pork was awesome. No sauce needed. It had a great smoky taste. The best though was the cheese grits. I am glad we had two orders of it. Even that was not enough. I would go out of my way to have breakfast here. BTW the decor is eclectic and well done, just like the food.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Stopped in here yesterday and ordered:1. Sausage-egg biscuit sandwich (on the bacon and cheese biscuit)2. Blueberry muffin3. SnickerdoodleWanted to love it, and there is definitely huge potential here, but there are also big issues:1. The biscuits are way too tiny for breakfast sandwiches. In fact, they don\\'t actually have breakfast sandwiches on the menu. That\\'s pretty surprising, considering how popular breakfast sandwiches are, and in a Southern bakery, where biscuits are king... I mean, how could you not? So please, management, make a larger (softer, less crumbly) biscuit just for breakfast sandwiches, and put them on the menu.Also, salt the egg. My sandwich was pretty bland because nobody had seasoned it, and taking apart a sandwich so small is perilous. I feared I\\'d never get it back together again.After finishing this (on site), I looked at my receipt and thought, \"How in the world did these three items come to $14? Again: Sandwich way too tiny. Please fix it, put it on the menu, and price reasonably!2. The muffin was quite good. It was the perfect amount of sweet (meaning not too much, for my taste) and had enough body to hold together well. I could go for a but more light-and-fluffiness, but I\\'d definitely order this again.3. Full disclosure: I ate the snickerdoodle today (so, one day after ordering) and it was totally dry and crumbly. Really unenjoyable. Makes me think it was not fresh when I ordered it. (How many days had it been under glass?) That being said, it was also just the right amount of sweet (so, not very) and I could tell that, were it fresher, it\\'d have had good flavor. So I might order this again, but I would eat it onsite and hand it back if it were old.All that being said, I really think this place has potential, and I\\'d come back to try some other items. In the meantime, though, I very much hope that management is listening to feedback and willing to give more thought to menu, flavor, and freshness.'},\n",

It was cold and had been sitting back there for a while. The fries were cold and greasy. The brisket was cold and dry as hell. No taste. The Cuban had the smallest amount of meat ever...seriously 1 slice of ham on a sandwich...really? We left and went to McDonalds. We didn't finish our meals or even eat much since it was cold and dry. In our group we have a diabetic and a bipolar 2. We can not wait that long for crappy ads food. I'll never eat here or recommend it ever again. McDonalds is better!\"},\n",

I think we will try the diner across the street.I ordered a Veggie omelet, and was served and omelet with literally 3 kinds of meats in it. 2 of my friends ordered biscuits and gravy, and were served gravy over toast without the server even asking if that would be okay. They wouldn\\'t have ordered that if they had been warned that they were out of biscuits. Everything was cold, except for my omelet. The only person at our table who actually got exactly what she ordered was a child who had ordered a side of bacon.I love the atmosphere at this place and I just wish that they would get better servers. They have 2 that get it right. 2 younger girls with long brown hair. If you get someone by that description, you might be alright.PS. When my friend brought up the substituted toast, out server said \"oh, I guess someone should have mentioned that, would you like a cookie?\" She then brought 2 oatmeal raisin cookies to us (too bad no one at the table was a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies-so strange that she didnt ask if they had a preference) At least the last time someone there screwed up so badly they gave us a discount.

It now has a Facebook page with several followers, so that's a start. Now, about the food. I mainly order their Kielbasa, which is fantastic. It has a terrific smokey flavor, with just the right amount of taste. It used to be very inconsistent there, but I think they finally hit the spot on it. Their chicken is also very good, on certain days, otherwise it is just very smokey and dry (by the way, all their meats are slow-cooked on a smoker just outside the store, and they start smoking them really early). Also, their side choices are just okay. Some of them are very rich (see below). Their ribs are good, but are a bit small for my liking, and their pork products are enticing enough to buy. They really push people to buy their pork because it is in fact really good. Lastly, their Shrimp n Grits. It is very, very rich in cream, so unless you've got a really strong stomach, I'd stay away from it unless you want to spend your whole afternoon fighting a losing battle in the bathroom.As for their bakery products, they leave out samples of their bread and bakery products regularly, so you certainly should try them! You get a slice of their home baked Pullman Loaf, and you can choose to get a Biscuit with your meal (definitely the Cheddar Bacon one is the best). Overall, for $8-$12 a person (depending on what you order), you'll definitely be full, and you'll definitely want to be back the next day. I know I did. One week, I was there 3 days in a row (we're not going to talk about what those trips did to my wasteline...), so you know it is special. If you are new to town, I recommend you stop by.

I dunno) \\xa0Far too liquidy/runny for my tastes. \\xa0Personally, I think pulling chicken, like you pull pork, is a mistake. Pulling pork or chicken means you inevitably get some of that tendon, end-of the muscle fat in yer pulled meat. \\xa0And that can work with pork, cause what's not to like about pork fat--not so with chick fat. \\xa0The solution is to cut the fat ends off, but that's a lotta extra work. Potato Salad: \\xa0Far as I can tell it was potatoes and mayo. \\xa0Nothing else detectable in it. \\xa0Really boring. \\xa0Good tater salad is so easy to make. \\xa0What a shame.Collards: \\xa0On a 1 to 5, they were a 2, at best. \\xa0Too vinegary-sour, no ham, and not much pot likker flavor to them. \\xa0Did not finish them.Since this was my second disappointing visit to Bonnie Blue, (first one was pork bbq) I won't be back.

NOPE. It doesn't have a woman's touch or Grandma's recipe taste. \\xa0Possibly the desserts, but anything that can get away with fillers is key here. \\xa0The strongest flavor is the smoked meats and even those have a good amount of fat and veins to remove. \\xa0When you get to the sides, the Mac n' cheese is cold and bland. \\xa0Sweet potato is good. The corn bread has no corn taste, more flour/baking powder, and dense/grainy. \\xa0The problem is that none of the food is taste tested because it's easy to pick up when something is not right. I think it would make a better sandwich shop and keep the desserts with the coffee bar. The knick knacks could go to give more room for benches or side tables. I truly felt like I was eating rations from the Civil War or last Thanksgiving thawed out left overs. \\xa0It's Virginia and I expected a little more home cooked taste. \\xa0I love the hospitality and it is a place people socialize. \\xa0They give out samples of treats on the counter and I got a free cookie for probably staring at my receipt for 5 minutes. \\xa0The coffee bar closes before the front counter does at night so keep that in mind if your making a run for an after dinner cup. \\xa0Have this coffee and a dessert (which are pretty good, but can run high and the slices are shrinking) and you'll enjoy this place best. \\xa0If you think this is good food, there are places on Yelp that would blow you away.\"},\n",

I've only ever had samples of the desserts and they're always tasty. So tasty that I don't buy the full thing because I know I'll just eat it all too quickly.The staff is friendly even when you drop in at the end of the day. \\xa0We're usually in and then out so not much to say there.But what really appeals to me is that it's a small market I can walk to for light grocery shopping. If I missed the farmer's market I could head over to Bonnie Blue and grab most of the veggies I wanted. They also serve and sell Hopscotch coffee which was a huge draw for us when we looked for a new city to live in. It sounds odd, but knowing the town has small-business vendors with quality was important to us.As nice as Bonnie Blue is, it's missing a certain something that makes it a 4-5 star venue. I can't quite identify what that is though. I'll probably try and show up at a reasonable hour or try more food to see if maybe I just have a limited experience.Edit: The flavors are definitely BBQ, and while done well I couldn't identify their pulled pork or chicken from a line-up.

The dining room requires a walk back behind the counter and point of sale. The lighting in the dining room is harsh standard fluorescent. The room itself is rather ramshackle, feeling rustic yet no consistent or tasteful theme. The entire experience is chaotic and off putting and I haven't even gotten to the actual food. I paid $13 for shrimp and grits. What I got was a bowl containing a small portion of grits drowned in some sort of broth with no distinguishable flavor. The shrimp were fresh with a nice color and of good size. They were pretty much the best part of the meal. I couldn't taste any of the cheese that was supposed to be a core part of the dish. A conglomeration of onions, scallions and tomatoes dominated the flavor. The side of collard greens were over cooked and featured globs of grey matter.\"},\n",

Very friendly, helpful staff. Very casual setup, order at the counter & they call your name. A few tables inside & a bunch out.
